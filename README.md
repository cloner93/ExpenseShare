# 🚀 ExpenseShare (Compose Multiplatform + Ktor Server)

**ExpenseShare** is a **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)** application designed for seamless group expense sharing.  
Users can create groups, add friends, record transactions, and the system automatically calculates how much each member owes or is owed.  
All data is synced through the backend — the app currently uses **no local database**.

AI-powered features will be added later to assist with categorization, analysis, and smart recommendations.

This repository includes both the **CMP client** and the **Ktor backend**.
